### Description

Poll data are fetched by using a POST request. By selecting either the Democratic button or the Republican button, the website will then submit a POST request to the Huffington Post API to fetch the desired poll data. After fetching the data. using d3, the data is then illustrated using a bar graph to show the individual percentage. jQuery and d3 is actively being used in this website.

The only difference in the code is the url that is called using the post.  So only adding a few lines to the original I can get a dramatic difference.  Cleaning up the percentages and removing one, offers a cleaner look and labeling at the top helps the user understand which page they are looking at.

My code is tweeked just a little it uses get instead of post because the data doesnt need to be post. I also cleaned up the percentages and made the page look cleaner.
